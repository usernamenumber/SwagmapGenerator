# SwagmapGenerator

The best way to see what this is all about is to clone this repo, open `SwagMapGenerator.html` locally in your browser, and read it.

The best way to play around with this code is:

1. Install [iPython](http://ipython.org/)
1. Run `ipython notebook SwagMapGenerator.ipynb`

Executing `swagmap_generatory.py` does some other tests with a larger and more detailed set of projects, stored in `swagifacts.yml`.
