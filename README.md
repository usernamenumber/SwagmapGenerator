# SwagmapGenerator

The best way to quickly see what this is all about is to read [this](http://geekdome.net/swagmapgen/). If you want more details...

***Be Warned:*** The code here is *very* rough and still has bits and pieces of several other ideas mixed into it. If you just look up the methods mentioned in the document linked above it should be ok, but don't expect much in the way of coherent design.

That said, the best way to play around with this code is to:

1. Install [iPython](http://ipython.org/)
2. Clone this repo
1. Run `ipython notebook SwagMapGenerator.ipynb`

Executing `swagmap_generatory.py` does some other tests with a larger and more detailed set of projects, stored in `swagifacts.yml`.
